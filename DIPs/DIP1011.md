## Rationale

Provide a way to define a function with the same ABI as a member function of an external type.  Adding the preceding feature would allow applications to use delegates in places where they previously couldn't.  

### Maybe go through druntime example?
Let's take a look at druntime for examples of delegates that could use this feature.
```
druntime/src/gc/impl/manual/gc.d
```
RootIterator or RangeIterator



### Maybe go through linux kernel example?
Take the linux kernel as an example.  In the header file "include/linux/pci.h" we have the following declaration:
```C
// ...
int pci_bus_alloc_resource(struct pci_bus *bus,
			struct resource *res, resource_size_t size,
			resource_size_t align, resource_size_t min,
			unsigned long type_mask,
			resource_size_t (*alignf)(void *,
						  const struct resource *,
						  resource_size_t,
						  resource_size_t),
			void *alignf_data);
// ...
```
The last 2 parameters of this function are equivelent to a delegate.  This function could be written in D as:
```C
// ...
int pci_bus_alloc_resource(pci_bus *bus,
			resource *res, resource_size_t size,
			resource_size_t align, resource_size_t min,
			ulong type_mask,
			resource_size_t delegate(void*,
						  const resource*,
						  resource_size_t,
						  resource_size_t) alignf);
// ...
```

## Abstract

It is proposed that

* `extern(delegate)` be added as a linkage type in order to create functions that are ABI-compatible with delegates
* taking the address of a UFCS call to an `extern(delegate)` function creates a delegate
* member functions be implicitly convertible to `extern(delegate)` functions

## Description

It is proposed that `extern(delegate)` be added as a linkage type, i.e.
```D
extern(delegate) void bar(Foo foo);
```

This linkage type modifies the ABI of the function by causing the first parameter to be passed in the same way a context pointer would be passed to a delegate function. If the first parameter of an `extern(delegate)` function is a class or a reference to a struct, then it will have the same ABI as a member function of that type. Every function in the following example has the same ABI:
```D
class SomeClass
{
    void memberFunc(int x, float y)
    {
    }
}

extern(delegate) void notMemberFunc(SomeClass s, int x, float y)
{
}

struct SomeStruct
{
    void memberFunc(int x, float y)
    {
    }
}

extern(delegate) void notMemberFunc(ref SomeStruct s, int x, float y)
{
}

extern(delegate) void notMemberFunc(SomeStruct* s, int x, float y)
{
}
```

A delegate can be retrieved from an `extern(delegate)` function using UFCS, i.e.
```D
extern(delegate) void bar(Foo foo)
{
    // ...
}

Foo foo;
void delegate() dg = &foo.bar;   // uses UFCS to get a "void delegate()" with the context pointer set to foo
```

By using UFCS to retrieve a delegate, the same syntax is used for `extern(delegate)` functions and member functions, namely, `&<object>.<function>`. This allows templates and mixins to work with both kinds. It also maintains type safety between the context pointer and the first parameter of the function by "piggy-backing" off the type checking done by the UFCS call.

For completeness, a member function should be implicitly convertible to an `extern(delegate)` function i.e.
```D
struct FooStruct
{
    void bar() // ...
}

class FooClass
{
    void bar() // ...
}

struct FooStruct fooStruct;
struct FooClass fooClass;

extern(delegate) function(ref FooStruct foo) fp1 = &fooStruct.bar;
extern(delegate) function(FooClass foo) fp2 = &fooClass.bar;
```

## Rationale

The first reason for this change is that it fills a hole in the semantics, namely, taking the address of a function in a UFCS call. This proposal assigns to that a meaning which is consistent with existing semantics.

The most prominent use case for `extern(delegate)` is defining a delegate function (a "delegate function" being a function that can be called as a delegate) that uses an external type for the context pointer.

> Note: this use case is different from the `std.functional.toDelegate` method, which can create a delegate from a function but does not allow the function to make use of the context pointer.

Say we want to create a delegate function that takes a `std.stdio.File` reference as the context pointer. Let's call it `writelnWithTime` and have it write a line to the file prefixed with the current time. Normally, functions intended to be used as delegates are added to a type as member functions, but member functions cannot be added to `std.stdio.File` because it is defined in another library. One solution is to create a wrapper type and define our new delegate function inside the wrapper, e.g.

```D
struct FileWrapper
{
    File* file;
    void writelnWithTime(string msg)
    {
        file.writeln(Clock.currTime, " ", msg);
    }
}

File file;
auto wrapper = FileWrapper(&file);
auto ourDelegate = &wrapper.writelnWithTime;
```

This works, but comes at a cost. It adds complexity in ownership semantics, potential for scoping errors, unnecessary runtime overhead, an extra level of indirection, and requires extra boilerplate code at the call site to retrieve the delegate. The worst problem with this solution is it requires a proliferation of wrapper types. If we define this wrapper in a library that is used by an application, and that application needs to add its own delegate functions, then it must create a "wrapper-wrapper" type, introducing another level of indirection. This adds no value to the program, but does introduce overhead and complexity.

Another solution is to throw type safety out the window, e.g.

```D
struct DummyType
{
    void writelnWithTime(string msg)
    {
        File* file = cast(File*)&this;
        file.writeln(Clock.currTime, " ", msg);
    }
}

File file;
DummyType dummy;
auto ourDelegate = &dummy.writelnWithTime;
ourDelegate.ptr = cast(void*)&file;
```

This also has a cost. Following are the problems seen at both the definition site and the call site.

#### At the function definition site:

* requires the function to be defined inside a dummy wrapper type
* requires a cast from the dummy type context pointer to the actual type you want; this throws away any type safety of the context pointer type and incurs some runtime overhead

#### At the function call site:

* requires an instance of the dummy type to be declared; note that this declaration has no purpose other than to get a delegate to the function
* once the delegate is retrieved, the `ptr` is set as an independent statement which creates a new place for a runtime error
* to set the delegate context pointer, the type must be cast to a `void*`; like the definition site, this throws away any type safety for the context pointer type and incurs some runtime overhead

With `extern(delegate)` the solution is simple, clear, and type-safe. No dummy wrapper type, no casting at the definition site or the call site, no runtime overhead, and delegate retrieval happens in one type-safe statement.

```D
extern(delegate) void writelnWithTime(ref File file, string msg)
{
    file.writeln(Clock.currTime, " ", msg);
}

File file;
auto ourDelegate = &file.writelnWithTime;
```

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

This proposal only requires new syntax that will cause no breakage.

### Examples
Example to demonstrate the usage:
```D
struct Foo
{
    void bar(int x)
    {
    }
}
extern(delegate) void baz(ref Foo foo, int x)
{
}

// Note that even though `bar` is defined as a member function inside
// the struct Foo, the `baz` function has an identical ABI with `bar`.

void delegate(int) dg;
Foo foo;

dg = &foo.bar;  // a normal member function delegate
dg(42);         // calls foo.bar(42)

dg = &foo.baz;  // using UFCS to retrieve a delegate to the extern(delegate) baz function
dg(42);         // calls baz(foo, 42);

dg = &baz;      // Error: cannot implicitly convert expression (baz) of type extern (delegate) void function(ref Foo, int) to void delegate(int)
```

A more realistic example:
```D
import std.stdio, std.datetime;

extern(delegate) void writelnWithTime(T)(ref File foo, T[] buffer)
{
    foo.writeln(Clock.currTime, " ", buffer);
}

void main()
{
    dumpInfo(&stdout.writeln!(const(char)[]));

    // Using UFCS to get a delegate to the extern(delegate) writelnWithTime function
    dumpInfo(&stdout.writelnWithTime!(const(char)[]))
}

void dumpInfo(void delegate(const(char)[]) writer)
{
    writer("Some Info:");
    writer("  2 = 2");
    writer("  3 != 4");
}
```

It may be worth noting that `extern(delegate)` functions can be imitated with existing semantics at the cost of type-safety and odd looking code with unclear intentions. The previous example could be "emulated" today like this:
```D
import std.stdio, std.datetime;

// Since there's currently no way to define a function that is ABI-compatible
// with a delegate, we must define our function as a method on a "dummy" type.
// The odd part is that we will be casting the "this" argument to the real
// type we are going to operate on, which in this case is a File*.
struct DummyType
{
    void writelnWithTime(T)(T[] buffer)
    {
        File* file = cast(File*)&this;
        file.writeln(Clock.currTime, " ", buffer);
    }
}

void main()
{
    dumpInfo(&stdout.writeln!(const(char)[]));

    // The DummyType "dummy" variable has no fields and takes no memory.
    // It's only purpose is to create a delegate to the method we want to call.
    DummyType dummy;
    auto writer = &dummy.writelnWithTime!(const(char));

    // Here's where we override the dummy ptr with the real object
    // we want to call the delegate with.
    writer.ptr = &stdout;

    dumpInfo(writer);
}

void dumpInfo(void delegate(const(char)[]) writer)
{
    writer("Some Info:");
    writer("  2 = 2");
    writer("  3 != 4");
}
```

### Compile-time errors

Not all types can be passed like a context pointer, i.e. they may be larger than a `void*`. If the first parameter of an `extern(delegate)` function is not compatible with a context pointer, a compile-time error should be asserted with a message like this:
```
function '<function>' cannot be declared extern(delegate) because the first parameter <reason>. [<suggested-fix>]
```
If the first parameter is a passed-by-value struct that is larger than `void*`, a good message would be:
```
function '<function>' cannot be declared extern(delegate) because the first parameter is too large. Consider adding the 'ref' attribute or making it a pointer.
```

Delegates only have one context pointer, which means functions that already use the context pointer like member functions or nested functions cannot be declared `extern(delegate)`. This violation should yield a compile-time error:
```D
struct Foo
{
    // Error: foo is a member function which cannot be declared extern(delegate) unless it is static
    extern(delegate) void foo(Bar bar)
    {
    }
    // OK because it is static
    extern(delegate) static void foo2(Bar bar)
    {
        // Error: foo3 is a nested function which cannot be declared extern(delegate) unless it is static
        extern(delegate) void foo3(Bar bar)
        {
        }
        // OK because it is static
        extern(delegate) static void foo4(Bar bar)
        {
        }
    }
}
```

Taking the address of an `extern(delegate)` function should return a function pointer just like a normal function. The difference is that the function pointer will have the `extern(delegate)` linkage type, meaning the type system will prevent it from being assigned and called like a regular function pointer.
```D
extern(delegate) void function(Foo foo) x;
void function(Foo foo) y = x; // Error: cannot implicitly convert expression (x) of type extern (delegate) void function(Foo) to void function(Foo)
```

This type of error already occurs with other linkage types so it should just work.

## The & operator ambiguity

Taking the address of a dotted member function (`&<object>.<member-function>`) creates a delegate. The same syntax can be used for a UFCS call with no arguments (`&<first-argument>.<non-member-function>`); however, in this case it is interpreted as taking the address of the return value of a call to the function with no arguments e.g.

```D
struct Foo
{
    ref int bar1() { /* ... */ }
}
ref int bar2(ref Foo foo) { /* ... */ }

Foo foo;
auto a = &foo.bar1; // creates a delegate, type of a is ref int delegate()
auto b = &foo.bar2; // calls function bar2 and takes the address of the return
                    // value, type of b is int*
```

Note that even though the member function call could be interpreted in the same manner as the UFCS call, the '&' operator gives precedence to intepreting it as a delegate. It is recommended that `extern(delegate)` functions behave the same way as member functions in this case for two reasons. The first is that it maintains consistent syntax between member functions and `extern(delegate)` functions, which makes it easier for templates/mixins to work with both kinds. The second reason is that with this precedence, there currently exists syntax that expresses the intent to call the function and take the address of the return value, namely, by including an empty parameter list `()` e.g.
```D
extern(delegate) ref int bar(ref Foo foo) { /* ... */ }
Foo foo;
auto a = &foo.bar;   // should create a delegate, type of a should be
                     // ref int delegate()
auto b = &foo.bar(); // this is clearly taking the address of the return
                     // value after calling the function, type of b is int*
```
If `extern(delegate)` functions do not maintain this precedence, there is currently no syntax that expresses the intent to create a delegate.

# Extras

It might be worth looking into how this can be used to improve the delegate type. A delegate has two fields, `ptr` and `funcptr`, where `funcptr` is a normal function pointer. It might make more sense to have the function pointer use the `extern(delegate)` linkage type. Should this be deemed useful, it's unlikely that changing `funcptr` would be worth breaking existing code, but a new property could be added that uses the `extern(delegate)` linkage type, i.e.
```D
struct __current_delegate_type__
{
    void* ptr;
    void function(<arg_types>) funcptr;
}

struct __new_delegate_type__
{
    void* ptr;
    union
    {
        void function(<arg_types>) funcptr;
        extern(delegate) void function(void*, <arg_types>) dgptr;
    }
}
```
